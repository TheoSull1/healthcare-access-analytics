# Healthcare Access & Wait Time Analytics Platform

## Overview
This project builds an analytics platform to help healthcare organizations understand and improve patient access and wait times.

## Business Problem
Healthcare organizations routinely track appointment volumes and wait times, but often lack a reliable, analytics-ready data model that connects scheduling, capacity, and patient flow. As a result, access teams struggle to identify where bottlenecks occur, quantify the impact of scheduling decisions, and evaluate tradeoffs between access, utilization, and experience.

This project focuses on building a scalable analytics foundation that enables healthcare organizations to analyze access and wait times consistently and support operational decision-making.

## Architecture
